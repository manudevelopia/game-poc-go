# Game Poc in Go
This is a project for my kid and me to learn Go and something about programming.

## Up to now...
- Application loads an image of a video game character. 
  - Create a screen window to play.
  - Learn how to load resources and present them on the screen. 
- Move the character on the screen.
  - Learn about coordinate axes and their position on the screen.
  - Move up-down-left-right by x-y change values.
  - Set limits on the screen to avoid character going out from the screen.
